# Java Learn - Next.js Application with Hydration Fixes

This is a Next.js application that demonstrates proper hydration mismatch prevention techniques.

## Hydration Mismatch Solutions Implemented

### 1. NoSSR Component (`src/components/NoSSR.jsx`)
- Prevents server-side rendering for client-only components
- Uses `useEffect` to ensure consistent rendering between server and client
- Provides fallback UI during hydration

### 2. Hydration Error Boundary (`src/components/HydrationErrorBoundary.jsx`)
- Catches and handles hydration errors gracefully
- Provides fallback UI when hydration fails
- Logs hydration errors for debugging

### 3. Windows Page Component (`src/app/windows/page.jsx`)
- Implements proper hydration guards using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Separates static content from dynamic/client-only content
- Uses consistent class names to prevent CSS hydration mismatches
- Implements loading states to prevent content flashing

### 4. Layout Configuration (`src/app/layout.js`)
- Consistent body className to prevent the original hydration mismatch
- Wraps application in error boundary for hydration error handling
- Proper metadata configuration

## Key Hydration Prevention Techniques

1. **Consistent Rendering**: Ensures server and client render the same content initially
2. **Client-Only Content**: Uses NoSSR wrapper for browser-specific functionality
3. **Hydration Guards**: Prevents dynamic content from causing mismatches
4. **Loading States**: Shows consistent loading UI until hydration completes
5. **Error Boundaries**: Gracefully handles hydration errors

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Original Issue

The application previously experienced hydration mismatch errors due to:
- Dynamic className modifications (e.g., `vsc-initialized` added by VS Code extension)
- Client-side only data being rendered on server
- Missing hydration guards for interactive components

All these issues have been resolved with the implemented solutions.
